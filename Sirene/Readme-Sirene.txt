 Sirene NPC Mod for BG:EE by Artemius_I
---------------------------------------

-----------------------
 Introduction & Details
-----------------------

This mod adds a new joinable NPC to the game: Sirene, a tiefling paladin of Ilmater. She has a custom kit: Martyr.

She can be found at the Song of the Morning, the temple of Lathander east of Beregost, outside the entrance to the main temple. She will only join a PC of nonevil alignment.

She begins at level 2 with her personal two-handed sword and the following stats:

	STR: 15
	DEX: 17
	CON: 15
	INT: 10
	WIS: 13
	CHA: 17
	Total: 87

As a tiefling, she also has 10% fire and cold resistance.

She has fourteen friendship talks with the PC. You can imply that you're interested in a romantic relationship regardless of race and alignment, but it won't develop into a full romance as of yet. There are currently no quests.

If the party falls below a reputation of 9, Sirene will warn the protagonist. If it continues to fall to below 5, she will leave permanently. She may be more tolerant and forgiving than followers of more militant faiths, but she has a limit.

She is compatible with all NPCs except Dorn in BG1, who she will come to conflict with quickly and force you to choose between them or let them come to blows. However, in Siege of Dragonspear, a sufficiently charismatic PC may convince them to hold a temporary truce.

Sirene currently has crossmod banter with White and Verr'Sza by Lava Del'Vortel.

 Martyr Kit
-----------------------

MARTYR: Martyrs are worshippers of Ilmater, the good god of suffering, endurance and perseverance. Paladins of Ilmater's order are compassionate and train themselves to become protectors of their allies and to alleviate the suffering of others.

Advantages:
- Hit Die: d12
- May use Lay on Hands three times per day.
- May use the Sacrifice ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 7 levels thereafter.

SACRIFICE: The martyr heals the target for 1d6+2 hit points per level and deals 1d6+2 non-lethal damage per level to <HIMHER>self up to a maximum of 1d6+20 at 10th level.

- May use the Martyrdom ability once per day starting at level 5. Gains an additional use every 7 levels thereafter.

MARTYRDOM: The target gains a +4 bonus to armor class and 50% resistance to physical damage while the martyr loses the same amount for 5 rounds + 1 round for every 3 levels gained.

- 12th level: Gains 10% resistance to physical damage. An additional 5% is gained at levels 16 and 20.
- 15th level: May use the Ilmater's Grace ability once per day.

ILMATER'S GRACE: The martyr regenerates for 3 hit points per second for 1 turn.

Disadvantages:
- -1 penalty to THAC0 every 5 levels (starting at level 1).
- May not cast Protection from Evil.
- May not Turn Undead.
- May not use ranged weapons.

-----------------------
 Friendship & Romance
-----------------------

Sirene has fourteen friendship dialogues with the PC. She has no romance in the traditional sense, but a PC of either gender with 12 or above charisma may flirt with her during these conversations. You can stop her from talking to you by directly asking her via PID.

She will begin her dialogues after completing the Nashkel mines quest, and will pause it prior to certain chapters if you have completed a certain stage of the friendship. Only talk 6 is area-conditional- you can trigger it by resting in an inn.

In Siege of Dragonspear, Sirene will have a brief romantic arc with the PC with around six talks.

 Installation
-----------------------

Unzip the files into your Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition folder (usually C:/Program Files/Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition/Data/00766) and run Setup-Sirene.exe

 FAQ
-----------------------

Q: (SoD) Where do I find Sirene?
A: At the Iron Throne building. If you miss her she'll show up at the army camps later.

Q: (SoD) Any quests?
A: No, but there is are a couple of encounters.

Q: (SoD) What are they?
A: They should be hard to miss. As long as you do all the sidequests you should find them.

Q: (SoD) New items?
A: Three, one from the encounter and another from a minor mod-added NPC. As for the third... well, keep Jaheira around for a while and you'll see.

Q: (SoD) Are there any conflicts?
A: None, at least fatally. Sirene and Dorn will not tolerate each other normally, but it's possible to convince them to making a truce.

Q: (SoD) How do I keep both Sirene and Dorn in the party?
A: Have a Charisma stat higher than 16.

Q: (SoD) The *SPOILER!* is kicking my ass!
A: Yeah... I tried to make it a somewhat difficult fight. Breach will make it a whole lot easier, but if you don't have it, you'll need to wear out its buffs for a bit. Since it's only one enemy, perhaps summoned creatures could be helpful?
