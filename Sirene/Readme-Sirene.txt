 Sirene NPC Mod for BG:EE by Artemius_I
---------------------------------------

-----------------------
 Introduction & Details
-----------------------

This mod adds a new joinable NPC to the game: Sirene, a tiefling paladin of Ilmater. She has a custom kit: Martyr.

She can be found at the Song of the Morning, the temple of Lathander east of Beregost, outside the entrance to the main temple. She will only join a PC of nonevil alignment.

She comes at level 2 with her personal two-handed sword and the following stats:

	STR: 15
	DEX: 17
	CON: 15
	INT: 10
	WIS: 13
	CHA: 17
	Total: 87

As a tiefling, she also has 10% fire and cold resistance.

She has fourteen friendship talks with the PC. You can imply that you're interested in a romantic relationship regardless of race and alignment, but it won't develop into a full romance as of yet. There are currently no quests.

She is compatible with all NPCs except Dorn, who she will come to conflict with quickly and force you to choose between them or let them come to blows.

 Martyr Kit
-----------------------

MARTYR: Martyrs are worshippers of Ilmater, the good god of suffering, endurance and perseverance. Paladins of Ilmater's order are compassionate and train themselves to become protectors of their allies and to alleviate the suffering of others.

ADVANTAGES:

- Hit Die: d12
- May use the Sacrifice ability once per day. Gains one use at level 1 and an additional use every 7 levels thereafter.

SACRIFICE: The martyr heals the target for 1d6+1 per level hit points and deals 1d6+1 per level nonlethal damage to <PRO_HIMHER>self.

- May use the Martyrdom ability once per day starting at level 5. Gains an additional use every 7 levels thereafter.

MARTYRDOM: The target gains a +4 bonus to armor class and 50% resistance to physical damage for 5 rounds while the martyr loses the same amount.

- 12th level: Gains 10% resistance to physical damage. An additional 5% is gained at levels 16 and 20.
- 15th level: May use the Ilmater's Grace ability once per day.

ILMATER'S GRACE: The martyr regenerates for 3 hit points per second for 1 turn.

DISADVANTAGES:

- -1 penalty to THAC0/damage every 5 levels (starting at level 1).
- May not cast Protection from Evil.
- May not Turn Undead.
- May not use ranged weapons.

-----------------------
 Friendship & Romance
-----------------------

Sirene has fourteen friendship dialogues with the PC. She has no romance in the traditional sense, but a PC of either gender with 12 or above charisma may flirt with her during these conversations. You can stop her from talking to you by directly asking her via PID.

She will begin her dialogues after completing the Nashkel mines quest, and will pause it prior to certain chapters if you have completed a certain stage of the friendship. Only talk 6 is area-conditional- you can trigger it by resting in an inn.

 Alternate Portrait
-----------------------

A new portrait created by the incredible artist Isandir is now an optional component. This portrait is in Baldur's Gate II art style and will be used for the BG2 component. Those that prefer the alternative may now use it in the first game.

-----------------------
 Installation
-----------------------

Unzip the files into your Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition folder (usually C:/Program Files/Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition/Data/00766) and run Setup-Sirene.exe
