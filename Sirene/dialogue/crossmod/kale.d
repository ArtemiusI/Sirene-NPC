== BC0Siren ~Iâ€”I beg your pardon?~
== X3KaleB ~Shouting. Like in battle. Your swings pack twice the punch when you lead with a nice loud shout. Completely true, every hero does it.~
== BC0Siren ~That is... well, even t'were truly the case, I am fighting to defend my allies, not mutilate my foes.~
== X3KaleB ~Pfft, come on. I wield a big sword. You wield a bigger sword. We don't have much in common, but we're both good ol' scrappers in the frontlines, wouldn't you agree?~
== BC0Siren ~Indeed, and in that, perhaps you may understand why I prefer calmness in battle. I would not like to lose myself in battle and have another suffer harm.~
== X3KaleB ~Ha, you knightly lots are bloody stubborn about the smallest things. Sure I can't tempt you to try: "Have a taste of devilish death!" at least once?~
== BC0Siren ~No, thank you.~
