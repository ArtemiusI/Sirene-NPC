@1	= ~Recruitment Drive

Sirene now travels with me.

I have recruited the tiefling paladin Sirene to my cause. Though I suspect I shall have to watch my actions carefully in order to avoid her righteous ire, her skill in combat and knowledge of healing will likely be a worthwhile asset to the group. If I decide to dismiss her, she will return to and follow the camp.~
@2  = ~When asked about her past, SIRENE averts her gaze and flatly states that there is little to say. She was orphaned and left to die as a babe, likely abandoned due to her apparent fiendish heritage. Only by luck did she survive certain death by being discovered by a travelling priest of Ilmater, who brought her to others of his faith and raised her as a Holy Warrior of Suffering, the order of paladins dedicated to the Crying God. She resents her own contradictory nature, though she is unsure of which side.

Sirene returned to Baldur's Gate after the fall of the Iron Throne to tend to the injured and those seeking refuge from of the crusade, and has joined your band in hope of taking a more direct approach to ending the Shining Lady's threat. Although she is showing signs of uncertainty towards fighting against the good men swayed by the crusade, she has assured you that she is fully committed to your cause so long as your hold good intentions.~
